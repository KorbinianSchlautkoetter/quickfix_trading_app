Purpose: Configuration files for the QuickFIX session settings. These files contain the necessary parameters such as connection settings, log settings, and session details.

### logs/client.log & logs/server.log:

Purpose: Log files for storing the logs generated by the QuickFIX engine and application. Useful for debugging and auditing purposes.

### quickfix_trading_app/__init__.py:

Purpose: Marks the directory as a Python package.

### quickfix_trading_app/application.py:

Purpose: Contains the implementation of the QuickFIX Application class. This class handles the core FIX protocol interactions such as message processing, session events, and message sending.

### quickfix_trading_app/message_processor.py:

Purpose: Contains logic for processing different types of FIX messages. This class is used by application.py to handle business logic.

### quickfix_trading_app/settings.py:

Purpose: Contains configuration settings for the application, such as file paths and other constants.

### quickfix_trading_app/main.py:

Purpose: Entry point of the application. It initializes the QuickFIX engine and starts the session.

### quickfix_trading_app/fix_utils.py:

Purpose: Contains utility functions for working with FIX messages, such as creating and parsing messages.

### quickfix_trading_app/fix_config.py:

Purpose: Contains utility functions to make FIX xml information available to other components.

### tests/__init__.py:

Purpose: Marks the directory as a Python package.

### tests/test_application.py, tests/test_message_processor.py, tests/test_fix_utils.py:

Purpose: Contains unit tests for the respective modules using a testing framework like unittest or pytest.

### setup.py:

Purpose: Script for setting up the project, making it installable as a package.

### requirements.txt:

Purpose: List the required site-packages.
- quickfix: The QuickFIX engine for Python.
- pytest: For testing.
- python-dotenv (optional): For managing environment variables, useful if you want to keep configuration settings outside your code.

Use python -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install them in your virtual environment.


## Overview of FIX Protocol Workflow
The FIX protocol facilitates communication between trading systems by defining a standardized format for messages and interactions. The basic workflow includes:
- Session Initialization: Establishing and maintaining connections between trading parties.
- Message Exchange: Sending and receiving various types of messages (e.g., orders, executions).
- Session Management: Handling session-related activities such as logon, heartbeat, and logout.
- Message Handling: Processing incoming and outgoing FIX messages.

### Example Methods in FixApplication
Let's assume you have the following typical methods in your FixApplication class:

onCreate(sessionID): Called when a new session is created.
onLogon(sessionID): Called when a session is successfully logged on.
onLogout(sessionID): Called when a session logs out.
toAdmin(message, sessionID): Used to modify outbound administrative messages.
fromAdmin(message, sessionID): Used to modify inbound administrative messages.
toApp(message, sessionID): Used to modify outbound application messages.
fromApp(message, sessionID): Used to process inbound application messages.

Admin Message Types:
   Heartbeat <0>
   Test Request <1>
   Resend Request <2>
   Reject <3>
   Sequence Reset <4>
   Logout <5>
   Logon <A>
   XML Message <n>

### Detailed Explanation of Workflow
1. Session Initialization
When a FIX session is initialized, the FixApplication class manages session creation and setup. The onCreate method is called when a new session is created.
2. Session Logon
When a session successfully logs on, the onLogon method is triggered. This indicates that the FIX connection has been established and authenticated.
3. Session Logout
When a session logs out, the onLogout method is called. This is useful for handling cleanup operations when a FIX session ends.
4. Message Handling
4.1 Outbound Administrative Messages
The toAdmin method is used to modify outbound administrative messages before they are sent.
4.2 Inbound Administrative Messages
The fromAdmin method is used to process inbound administrative messages received from the other party.
4.3 Outbound Application Messages
The toApp method is used to modify outbound application messages before they are sent.
4.4 Inbound Application Messages
The fromApp method is used to process inbound application messages received from the other party.

In QuickFIX, message handling is done by overriding the onMessage method in your FixApplication class. The onMessage method is invoked when a message of a specific type is received. You define different onMessage methods for each message type you want to handle.
